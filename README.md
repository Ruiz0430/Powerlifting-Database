## Description
This project implements a structured relational database designed to manage and organize information related to powerlifting competitions. Built using SQL, the database supports the storage and retrieval of key data about athletes, teams, competitions, individual lift attempts, and user credentials. The schema is defined under the Powerlift namespace and simulates a real-world scenario involving athletic performance tracking and competition logistics.
